    <p>Joseph was an amazing boy that unfortunately left us before his time from medulloblastoma.  A couple of the amazing things 
    about him was his compassion and drive for exploration.  When faced with the decision on what he would like to do for his wish, 
    he simply said “I want everyone to be happy.”  Through many conversations he said he wanted to see the stars.  We thought 
    about this for a minute and decided on locations.  Through the wish granter, we decided on the first national dark sky city, Moab Utah.</p>
  </div>  
  <div id="rock">  
    <p>After several rounds of chemo treatments, the time had come he was finally able to board the plane and make his wish come true.  
    Throughout his trip, Joseph enjoyed the sights and stars.  One of his favorite memories from the trip was collecting rocks in the National 
    parks.  With only some of his strength regained from treatment, he hiked and hiked and did not give up.  This just shows how much 
    spirit he had through every obstacle.  </p>

  <div id="stars">
    <p>During his trip, his wish was finally granted.  With a night sky guide, he peered through a powerful telescope at the many wonders 
    of the universe.  For those moments, he wasn’t in pain, he wasn’t thinking of what will happen next.  He was simply a little boy in awe 
    of what the universe holds.  We spent the night with him lying on the ground, pointing out the constellations in the sky. Through Make-a-Wish, 
    Joseph was just like any other boy.  </p>

    <p>Through this experience, Joseph proved to us just how amazing he was.  In this time, all he was thinking about was others.  His compassion 
    and drive made him such a wonderful child that was simply too good for this world. </p>
